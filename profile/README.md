## Hi there 👋

We are a consulting organisation that provides code development in a flexible way for the crypto – blockchain – NFT - DAO ecosystems.
We specialise in Rust, hence the name, but anything that gravitates around the industry is fine by us.
We have been training already expecienced developers and then finding them missions or code bounties to put their hands on. The way we work is a community based process.
 
For example, in order to address the lack of substrate developers, we started our series of
[open source tutorials](https://github.com/rusty-crewmates/substrate-tutorials).

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
