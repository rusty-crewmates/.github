## Hi there 👋

We are a consulting company that provides code development in a flexible way for the crypto – blockchain – NFT ecosystems.
We specialise in Rust, hence the name, but anything that gravitates aroung the blockchain ecosystem is fine by us.
We have been training already expecienced developers and then finding them missions or code bounties to work on. We work on a community based process.
 
For example, in order to address the lack of substrate developers, we started our series of
[open source tutorials](https://github.com/rusty-crewmates/substrate-tutorials).

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
